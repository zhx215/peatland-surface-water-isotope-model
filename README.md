The example code for running the model to simulate spatial isotopic varations of peatland surface water in a 1-D transect, developed by Xia et al. and presented in a manuscsript submitted to Mires and Peat (submission date: Jan 26, 2024). The simulation output is same as the control run shown in Figure 6.<br/>
